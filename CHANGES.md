  - Improved sign-in redirect with preserved intended destination
  - Added safeguards against navigation errors during authentication
  - Resolved compatibility issues between Next.js 15 and Clerk authentication

## Next Steps

After these foundational changes, the project is ready to continue development with Task Master using the improved infrastructure:

1. Continue task-driven development with a solid testing foundation
2. Apply TDD principles to all new features
3. Ensure comprehensive test coverage
4. Use the auto-commit workflow for reliable commits
5. Continue developing the ArticuLITE game features 

## Known Issues

### Node.js and Next.js Compatibility

There are known compatibility issues between newer Node.js versions and Next.js 15:

- Node.js v23.10.0 causes module resolution errors with Next.js
- The specific error relates to `Cannot find module '../server/require-hook'` in the Next.js binary
- These issues occur when running with turbopack (`next dev --turbopack`)

#### Workaround Options:

1. Use Node.js v18.x or v20.x LTS for development (recommended)
2. Temporarily switch to the standard Next.js dev server with `--no-turbo` flag:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --no-turbo
   ```
3. If using fresh-articulite, ensure all dependencies are properly installed with:
   ```bash
   cd fresh-articulite
   npm ci
   ```
