      "taskTitle": "Setup React Project Foundation",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the React project setup into specific technical steps including project initialization, routing setup, CSS configuration, folder structure creation, version control setup, and deployment pipeline configuration.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves several distinct technical components (React initialization, routing, CSS, project structure, Git, deployment) that are moderately complex but well-documented. Each component represents a clear subtask with defined boundaries."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Password Protection System",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the password protection system implementation into specific components including login UI design, password validation logic, secure password storage, authentication state management, session persistence, and logout functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing a complete authentication flow with several interconnected components. While it's client-side only (reducing complexity), it still involves security considerations, state management, and persistence that warrant careful breakdown."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Local Storage System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the local storage system development into data model design, storage utility functions, versioning implementation, error handling mechanisms, and custom hook creation for simplified state management.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves designing complex data models and a robust storage system with versioning and error handling. The data relationships and persistence logic add significant complexity, requiring careful architecture to ensure maintainability."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate OpenAI API for Question Generation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the OpenAI integration into specific components including API service creation, prompt implementation, caching mechanism, category-based generation functions, error handling, token usage tracking, and API key management.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines external API integration with complex caching logic and error handling. The token usage tracking and optimization add additional complexity. The system must be robust against API failures while maintaining good user experience."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Build Game Setup Interface",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the game setup interface into team creation UI, random assignment functionality, timer configuration, skip settings implementation, play mode selection, and question pre-caching system.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating multiple UI components with various configuration options. The team creation, settings management, and question pre-caching add moderate complexity, requiring careful state management and user experience design."

    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Core Gameplay Loop",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the core gameplay implementation into timer system, question display mechanism, answer handling, turn summary creation, team rotation logic, game state management, and transition animations between game phases.",
      "reasoning": "This is the most complex task as it implements the central game mechanics with multiple interconnected systems. The turn-based gameplay, state management, and transitions between game phases require careful coordination and robust implementation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Tabletop Integration Features",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the tabletop integration features into companion mode UI, board position tracking, movement instructions, category synchronization, special space handling, and visual aid creation matching the physical board.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires creating a digital companion for a physical game, which introduces complexity in synchronization and instruction clarity. The need to match physical components and provide clear guidance adds significant UX challenges."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Question Feedback System",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the question feedback system into rating interface design, feedback data structure implementation, feedback utilization mechanism for question improvement, and analytics for question performance tracking.",
      "reasoning": "This task is moderately complex, involving feedback collection and storage with some analytics. The system is relatively self-contained with clear boundaries, making it easier to implement than some of the more integrated game features."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Add UI/UX Enhancements",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the UI/UX enhancements into animation implementation, sound effect integration, color coding system, typography and readability improvements, and responsive design implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves enhancing the user experience across multiple dimensions. While each enhancement is moderately complex, the need to maintain consistency across the application and ensure good performance adds complexity to the implementation."
